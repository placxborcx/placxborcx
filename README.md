## Projects

1. **BirdDetection (Team Project)**  
   AI-powered bird detection platform supporting images, video, and audio.  
   - Contributions: Built landing & main pages, integrated frontend–backend APIs, secured with AWS Cognito & IAM (least privilege).  
   - Tools: AWS Amplify, Cognito, IAM, Lambda  

2. **Model Extraction Attack & Defense (Individual)**  
   - Attack: Trained CNN surrogate via black-box queries on MNIST, replicating the target model with high accuracy.  
   - Defense: Applied output protection to limit extraction while preserving usability.  
   - Tools: VSCode2 (local)  

3. **Membership Inference Attack & Defense (Individual)**  
   - Attack: Built shadow models (8 NNs) with induced overfitting, extracting membership signals from outputs.  
   - Defense: Designed Four-Layer Defense System to mitigate MIA while keeping model utility.  
   - Tools: VSCode2 (local)
